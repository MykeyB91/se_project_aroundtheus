### Overview

- Figma
- Images
- HTML5
- CSS
- Flex/Grid Layout
- Media queries

**Intro**

In this project I was instructed to create a responsive web-design. In order to achieve this I needed to use various technologies and tools to reach these requirements. From 'Figma' to 'HTML5' along with various layout techniques.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1). Above is a link to the 'Figma' design used in this project. Figma is a design tool that developers use in creating web layouts. Figma provides the necessary elements, styles and images needed to meet design requirements.

**Images**

In order to optimize the quality of images used in the design, once exported, anyone can use the link below. This will ensure one's images load faster.

**HTML5**

The markup language used in this project was HTML5. This allows for a clean, clear and concise layout. Using the BEM methodology ensures a developer can provide a legible markup for any future users. Further, HTML5 provides the opportunity for a devloper to also hone their skills in properly identifying blocks, elements or modifiers. It is a very functional and easy to use tool.

**CSS**

CSS is the stylesheet used to apply our styles for this project. To avoid styling the wrong area of our design we again implemented BEM by way importing our BLOCK directory and it's files into index.css. This allows browsers to properly apply the correct styles to the design. It also, provides an efficient and effective way for any developer(s) to go in and make any necessary adjustments to the design.

**Flex/Grid Layout**

To achieve the desired design Flex and Grid layouts were applied to various sections of the project. For example in both the profile and header blocks we used both Flex and Grid. Understanding how to apply these layouts are essential to a responsive design. With Flex and Grid we are able to adjust the viewport (i.e. device width) to reflect our layout on a mobile, tablet or desktop device. Properly using using these techniques will ensure one meets the requirenets of a responsive layout.

**Media Queries**

Last but not least, this design uses media queries. Along with using 'Flex and Grid' layouts in our design, we also used 'Media Queries'. Media queries are breakpoints used in the design to help our layout respond to any device. This is a crucial and essential part of any responsive web-design. Understanding this function will undoubtedly provide an overall quality experience to any developer or user.

I hope this overview provides enough details on the project. Below is my website along with a video of me describing the project.
